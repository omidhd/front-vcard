                    </p>

                    <p class="my-4">Mr. Adams advises clients on a variety of business issues during the life cycle of
                        the
                        business, often beginning prior to formation and continuing as the business grows and succeeds
                        until
                        the business, or a unit of the business, is liquidated upon sale or other circumstances. He
                        often

                        array of business, tax, philanthropy and business succession matters, including business
                        reorganizations, configurations and divestitures. Mr. Adams has substantial experience with the
                        formation of corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships (including general
                        partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships and limited liability limited

                        agreements, joint venture agreements, corporate shareholders' agreements and other arrangements

                        with
                        entities formed across the nation.</p>

                    <p class="my-4">Furthermore, Mr. Adams has served as outside counsel for clients operating in a
                        variety

                        industries, including healthcare, hospitality, agribusiness, food service and distribution. Mr.
                        Adams also works closely with clients to understand their businesses, their corporate and
                        ownership

                        respect to
                        their legal needs.</p>

                    <p class="my-4">Additionally, Mr. Adams represents not-for-profit entities with respect to various
                        tax
                        and corporate
                        matters, including formation of the entity and assistance in obtaining tax-exempt status from
